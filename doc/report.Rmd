```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r t-test example}
# we definitely need to include `var.equal = FALSE` because of our class imbalance
# we need to run this test for each 
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code)
t.test(score ~ sub_population, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

## Aim


## Data


## Methods

Example: The R programming language and the following R packages were used to perform the analysis: knitr and tidyverse. The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found here: https://github.com/ttimbers/equine_numbers_value_canada_rmd.

## Results


## Notes

From Tiffany's example:  
```{r choosing-k, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. 30-fold cross validation classification accuracy as K is varied.", out.width = '40%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("../results/accuracy_vs_k.png")
```

## Notes about the .bib file

From Tiffany's example:  
* This is where I'll put my references once I start collecting them

* the @ part tells you what type of citation it is (ex. manuscript, book, etc)
* Streetetal is what you name your reference so you can actually reference it

Testing a reference [@test_ref].
* if you don't put a reference in the text, it won't show up in the bibliography.

* to get the citation for a package, type this is the Console: `citation(package = "tidyverse")` where you select the package you want
* `citation()` gets you teh bibliography stuff for the R package
