# Summary

Using [BC Schools Foundational Skills Assessment (FSA)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-schools-foundation-skills-assessment-fsa-) scores from school years 2007/2008 through 2018/2019, we looked at whether there are differences in exam performance between different subgroups and school types to answer two main inferential questions:  

1. Is there a difference in how well BC Public School vs Independent School students perform on the FSA exam?  
2. Is there a difference in how well Aboriginal vs Non Aboriginal students perform on the FSA exam?

By conducting hypothesis testing using t-test statistics and a 95% confidence interval, we determined that:  

1. Yes, there is a difference in how well BC Public School vs Independent School students perform on the Numeracy and Reading portions of the FSA exam; Independent School student scores are higher than Public School student scores.
2. Yes, there a difference in how well Aboriginal vs Non Aboriginal students perform on the Numeracy and Reading portions of the FSA exam; Non Aboriginal student scores are higher than Aboriginal student scores

# Introduction

Each year, the [BC Ministry of Education](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/organization/ministry-of-education) administers Foundational Skills Assessment (FSA) exams to all Grade 4 and 7 students in the province. The exams are split into three sections to provide parents, teachers, schools, and other organizations with information on how well students are performing in the areas of Numeracy, Reading, and Writing.

By analyzing the differences in FSA scores between different school types (Public / Independent) and subgroups (Aboriginal / Non Aboriginal) using this publicly available dataset, we aim to highlight potential discrepancies in the quality of education that young students receive within the province.  

We believe it's important for every child in BC to receive a quality education regardless of whether they attend public or independent (private) schools. We also believe that by highlighting differences in the performance of different subgroups on these tests, readers may consider the possibility that additional programs to reduce these differences are needed.

# Methods

## Data
```{r loads data, include=FALSE}
data = read_csv('../data/clean_data.csv')
```

The data used in this project was provided by [BC Ministry of Education](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/organization/ministry-of-education) - [Education Analytics](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/organization/education-analytics) and is licenced under an [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data/open-government-licence-bc).

This project uses two data files that contain FSA scores from BC students in Grades 4 and 7. The data in the two files have some differences in score summary columns (see FSA field definitions for more info), so only the common fields from these data files are included in this project's analysis. Rows with summary scores on provincial and district levels have been removed so that only school-level information remains. One row of erroneous data was also removed.

The score shown on each row of data represents the average score of all students who wrote the specified exam (Numeracy / Reading / Writing), within the noted school and subgroup. Since the Writing portion of the exam was scored out of 12 from 2007/08-2016/17 but was changed to be scored out of 4 (only one question) in 2017, we have removed it from this analysis and focus only on scores within the Numeracy and Reading portions of the FSA exam.

## Analysis

The R and Python programming languages [@R; @Python] and the following R and Python packages were used in this project:
- tidyverse [@tidyverse]
- knitr [@knitr]
- docopt [@docopt]
- docoptpython [@docoptpython]
- dplyr [@dplyr]
- repr [@repr]
- pandas [@pandas]
- readr [@readr]
- infer [@infer]

T-tests were carried out to test the null hypothesis that there are no differences in the means of the aggregate FSA scores between students of different subgroups, as shown in this report. Additional code used to develop this report can be found here: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Group304 

# Results

**Question 1: Is there a difference in how well BC Public School vs Independent School students perform on the FSA exam?**  

**EDA**  
During the exploratory data analysis portion of this project, we found that across most subgroups the mean aggregate FSA scores for students in independent schools were higher than the scores for students in public schools, and this difference was seen across all years.

The bar plots below show scores across all subgroups for students from BC Independent Schools and BC Public Schools for Numeracy and Reading sections of the exam. The line graphs below show the scores for all students across time (2007/2008 - 2018/2019 school years) for the same exam sections. BC Independent School scores are represented in red, and BC Public School scores are represented in blue.

*Note:* The graphs below have been shrunken to fit within the width of this report and may be difficult to read. The purpose of including these graphs is simply to illustrate that mean aggregate scores for BC Independent School students were generally higher than mean aggregate scores for BC Public School students across all subgroups and time periods. To view larger versions of the graphs, please see the 'img' folder of this project repository.

```

**ANALYSIS**  
To determine if the differences in mean aggregate FSA scores seen above are significant, we first visualized the scores using boxplots and histograms to plot the mean aggregate scores for each exam section.

The following plots visualize the difference in scores using boxplots. The boxplots for the mean aggregate scores between the subgroups does not overlap much for both Numeracy and Reading sections of the exam, which suggests that the difference in scores may be significant.

```{r Q1 Numeracy Boxplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../img/fig_pi_numeracy.png', '../img/fig_pi_reading.png'))
```

The following histograms were created by taking random samples of aggregate scores from both groups and plotting the distribution of their means.[ROBERT - PLEASE FILL THIS SECTION OUT]

```{r Q1 Numeracy Histogram, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../img/fig_pi_histogram_numeracy.png', '../img/fig_pi_histogram_reading.png'))
```

After visualizing the differences, we conducted t-tests at a 95% confidence interval to confirm that the differences are actually significant at this level, and find that they are:

T-test for Differences in Numeracy Scores Between BC Independent School Students and BC Public School Students:
```{r t-test School Type - Numeracy, eval=TRUE}
# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = data %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Numeracy')

# Returns t statistic score
t.test(score ~ public_or_independent, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

T-test for Differences in Reading Scores Between BC Independent School Students and BC Public School Students:
```{r t-test School Type - Reading, eval=TRUE}
# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = data %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Reading')

# Returns t statistic score
t.test(score ~ public_or_independent, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

**Question 2: Is there a difference in how well Aboriginal vs Non Aboriginal students perform on the FSA exam?**

**EDA**  

During the exploratory data analysis portion of this project, we found that scores for Aboriginal students were generally lower than scores for Non Aboriginal students in both Numeracy and Reading sections of the FSA exam. The bar plots below show this difference, and the line plots below show that the scores are consistently lower for Aboriginal students over time.

```{r EDA2 Bar Plots, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../img/bar_plot_ab_numeracy.png', '../img/bar_plot_ab_read.png'))
```

Fig: Mean aggregate scores by subgroup (Aboriginal / Non Aboriginal)

```{r EDA2 Line Plots, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../img/line_ab_numeracy.png', '../img/line_ab_reading.png'))
```

**ANALYSIS**  
To determine if the differences in mean aggregate FSA scores seen above are significant, we again visualized the scores using boxplots and histograms to plot the mean aggregate scores for each exam section.

The following plots visualize the difference in scores using boxplots. Here we see that the boxplots for the different subgroups (Aboriginal / Non Aboriginal) do not overlap, which is a strong indicator that there is a significant difference in scores between the groups.

```{r Q2 Numeracy Boxplot, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../img/fig_ana_numeracy.png', '../img/fig_ana_reading.png'))
```

```{r Q2 Numeracy Histogram, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}

```

Fig: Histograms showing distributions of mean aggregate scores for Numeracy and Reading section of the FSA exam by subgroup (Aboriginal / Non Aboriginal)

After visualizing the differences, we conducted t-tests at a 95% confidence interval to confirm that the differences are actually significant at this level, and find that they are:

T-test for Differences in Numeracy Scores Between Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal Students:
```{r t-test Subgroups - Numeracy, eval=TRUE}
# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ABORIGINAL' | sub_population == 'NON ABORIGINAL') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Numeracy')

t.test(score ~ sub_population, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

T-test for Differences in Reading Scores Between Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal Students:
```{r t-test Subgroups - Reading, eval=TRUE}
# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ABORIGINAL' | sub_population == 'NON ABORIGINAL') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Reading')

t.test(score ~ sub_population, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

## Conclusion

The graphs and statistical tests above confirm that there are significant differences in mean aggregate FSA exam scores between students from BC Independent Schools and BC Public Schools, and between Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students, in Numeracy and Reading portions of the exam. The next question we'd like *you* to answer is what we can do about this.

## Notes

As with all inferential analyses such as this one, it's possible that there are confounding variables that have not been accounted for in this project. Such variables may include the funding each school receives, the level of affluence of a school's district, whether the neighborhood offers programs to improve numeracy and reading skills, and so on. In an effort to combat this issue, we did also run t-tests using subsets of the data to confirm that there are significant differences in scores for Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students even in subsets of the data that include only schools with both subgroups of students. 

To determine if schools met the criteria of having both Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students, the data was filtered to include only schools who had both Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal Grade 4 students who wrote the exam in the 2018/2019 school year. For more details, please see the `src/filter_schools_both_subgroups.py` script.

The following t-test confirms that there is a significant difference at the 95% confidence interval between Numeracy scores of Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students:

```{r Notes Load subset data 1, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
sub_data <- read_csv('../data/filtered_schools_both_subgroups.csv')
```

```{r Notes Subdata Difference in Scores for Numeracy Test, eval=TRUE}

# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = sub_data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ABORIGINAL' | sub_population == 'NON ABORIGINAL') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Numeracy')

t.test(score ~ sub_population, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

The following t-test confirms that there is a significant difference at the 95% confidence interval between Reading scores of Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students:

```{r Notes Subdata Difference in Scores for Reading Test, eval=TRUE}

# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = sub_data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ABORIGINAL' | sub_population == 'NON ABORIGINAL') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Reading')

t.test(score ~ sub_population, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

However, this isn't to say that there are no differences between schools with and without Aboriginal students. In fact, the following t-test confirms that there is also a significant difference in Numeracy scores (for all students) for schools with Aboriginal students and students without Aboriginal students.

```{r Notes Load subset data 2, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
new_data <- read_csv('../data/new_clean_data.csv')
```

```{r Notes School Difference in Scores for Numeracy Test, eval=TRUE}
# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = new_data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ALL STUDENTS') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Numeracy')

t.test(score ~ has_both, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

And this test confirms that there is also a significant difference in Reading scores (for all students) for schools with Aboriginal students and students without Aboriginal students.

```{r Notes School Difference in Scores for Reading Test, eval=TRUE}

# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = new_data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ALL STUDENTS') %>%
  filter(fsa_skill_code == 'Reading')

t.test(score ~ has_both, data = filtered_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```

What all these tests mean is that there may be other factors (ex. school district affluence) that happen to be associated with whether a school has Aboriginal students (ex. Aboriginal communities may be more likely to live in areas with lower affluence) that contribute to whether a school's students perform well on the FSA exam. But, even if you look at only schools with both Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students, there is still a significant difference in the scores between these two subgroups. We chose not to filter the dataset used in the `Analysis` section of this report to include only schools with both Aboriginal and Non Aboriginal students so that we would have a larger dataset to sample from when visualizing the differences.
