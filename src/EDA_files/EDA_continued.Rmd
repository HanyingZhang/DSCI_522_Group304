During the EDA process we wondered if we should be concerned in a potential class imbalance between subgroups. This EDA document is a continuation of the previous EDA, but using the output of the new clean_data.py script, and seeks to see if there are any other changes that we need to make in the data cleaning process.

```{r}
library(docopt)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Loads clean data
data = read_csv('../data/clean_data.csv')

# Filters data for only the subgroups of interest
filtered_data = data %>%
  filter(sub_population == 'ABORIGINAL' | sub_population == 'NON ABORIGINAL')
  
head(filtered_data)
```
